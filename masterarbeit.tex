    \section{Visual Stimuli}\label{sec:visual-stimuli}
	\subsection{Preliminary Experiments} 
	Preliminary experiments have been conducted in order to establish a proper paradigm for the \textit{main} experiments of the project. 
	The rationale of these experiments is further discussed under section~\ref{sec:MV-preliminary-experiments}. 
	Their main goal is comparing reaction times between scrambled image and emotional image trials.
	
	For conducting these experiments we have used a home-brewed script openly published on GitHub.
\chapter{Results}
	\section{Preliminary Experiments}
	In order to establish an experimental paradigm which affords the comparison between emotion recognition and simple visual matching, we need to select stimuli whose matching is correspondingly difficult.
	For the emotion recognition trials, we decided for faces with emotional "concentrations" (???) of 40\% and 100\% (as discussed in section~\ref{sec:visual-stimuli}).
