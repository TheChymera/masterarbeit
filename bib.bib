  Abstract                 = {Historically, the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system has been implicated in arousal, but recent findings suggest that this system plays a more complex and specific role in the control of behavior than investigators previously thought. We review neurophysiological and modeling studies in monkey that support a new theory of LC-NE function. LC neurons exhibit two modes of activity, phasic and tonic. Phasic LC activation is driven by the outcome of task-related decision processes and is proposed to facilitate ensuing behaviors and to help optimize task performance (exploitation). When utility in the task wanes, LC neurons exhibit a tonic activity mode, associated with disengagement from the current task and a search for alternative behaviors (exploration). Monkey LC receives prominent, direct inputs from the anterior cingulate (ACC) and orbitofrontal cortices (OFC), both of which are thought to monitor task-related utility. We propose that these frontal areas produce the above patterns of LC activity to optimize utility on both short and long timescales.},

  Abstract                 = {Impulse activity was recorded extracellularly from noradrenergic neurons in the nucleus locus coeruleus (LC; 47 single-cell and 126 multicell recordings) of four cynomolgus monkeys performing an oddball visual discrimination task. For juice reward, the subjects were required to release a lever rapidly in response to an infrequent (10-20\% of trials) target cue (CS+) that was randomly intermixed with nontarget (CS-) stimuli presented on a video display. All LC neurons examined were phasically and selectively activated by target cues in this task. Other task events elicited no consistent response from these neurons (juice reward, lever release, fix-spot stimuli, nontarget stimuli). In one animal, nontarget cues phasically inhibited LC neurons. Phasic LC excitatory responses to target cues in this task occurred at a relatively short latency (mean = 90.7 msec), approximately 200 msec prior to the behavioral response (lever release). In addition, LC response magnitudes varied with behavioral performance, being substantially attenuated during epochs of poor performance (high false alarm rate). There was a positive correlation (r = 0.30, p < 0.0001) between the latency of LC responses and the latency of behavioral responses to same target cues, consistent with the possibility that LC responses may have a role in selective attention by facilitating responses to the CS+ stimulus. Analyses of behavioral response latencies to pairs of stimuli indicated that LC responses may facilitate behavioral responses to subsequent sensory cues, consistent with a role of this system in sustained attention/vigilance. Moreover, responses became reduced in magnitude over time during prolonged task performance (> 90 min), in parallel with a behavioral performance decrement. These results show that LC neurons are activated selectively by attended stimuli that demand a rapid response in this task, and that such LC responses may contribute to conditioned behavioral responses.},

  Abstract                 = {Stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, affect a disproportionate number of women. We previously demonstrated that the major brain norepinephrine (NE)-containing nucleus, locus coeruleus (LC) is more sensitive to stressors and to the stress-related neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in female compared to male rats. Because the LC-NE system is a stress-responsive system that is thought to be dysregulated in affective disorders, sex differences in LC structure or function could play a role in female vulnerability to these diseases. The present study used different approaches to compare LC dendritic characteristics between male and female rats. Immunofluorescence labeling of tyrosine hydroxylase, the norepinephrine synthetic enzyme, revealed that LC dendrites of female rats extend further into the peri-LC region, covering a significantly greater area than those of males. Optical density measurements of dendrites in the peri-LC revealed increased dendritic density in females compared to their male counterparts. Additionally, immunoreactivity for synaptophysin, a synaptic vesicle protein, was significantly greater in the LC in female rats, suggesting an increased number of synaptic contacts onto LC processes. Individual LC neurons were juxtacellularly labeled with neurobiotin in vivo for morphological analysis. LC dendritic trees of females were longer and had more branch points and ends. Consistent with this, Sholl analysis determined that, compared to males, LC dendrites of females had a more complex pattern of branching. The greater dendritic extension and complexity seen in females predicts a higher probability of communication with diverse afferents that terminate in the peri-LC. This may be a structural basis for heightened arousal in females, an effect which may, in part, account for the sex bias in incidence of stress-related psychiatric disorders.},

  Abstract                 = {Systemizing is the drive to analyse systems or construct systems. A recent model of psychological sex differences suggests that this is a major dimension in which the sexes differ, with males being more drawn to systemize than females. Currently, there are no self-report measures to assess this important dimension. A second major dimension of sex differences is empathizing (the drive to identify mental states and respond to these with an appropriate emotion). Previous studies find females score higher on empathy measures. We report a new self-report questionnaire, the Systemizing Quotient (SQ), for use with adults of normal intelligence. It contains 40 systemizing items and 20 control items. On each systemizing item, a person can score 2, 1 or 0, so the SQ has a maximum score of 80 and a minimum of zero. In Study 1, we measured the SQ of n = 278 adults (114 males, 164 females) from a general population, to test for predicted sex differences (male superiority) in systemizing. All subjects were also given the Empathy Quotient (EQ) to test if previous reports of female superiority would be replicated. In Study 2 we employed the SQ and the EQ with n = 47 adults (33 males, 14 females) with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA), who are predicted to be either normal or superior at systemizing, but impaired at empathizing. Their scores were compared with n = 47 matched adults from the general population in Study 1. In Study 1, as predicted, normal adult males scored significantly higher than females on the SQ and significantly lower on the EQ. In Study 2, again as predicted, adults with AS/HFA scored significantly higher on the SQ than matched controls, and significantly lower on the EQ than matched controls. The SQ reveals both a sex difference in systemizing in the general population and an unusually strong drive to systemize in AS/HFA. These results are discussed in relation to two linked theories: the 'empathizing-systemizing' (E-S) theory of sex differences and the extreme male brain (EMB) theory of autism.},

In this article we review psychological theories of empathy and its measurement. Previous instruments that purport to measure this have not always focused purely on empathy. We report a new self-report questionnaire, the Empathy Quotient (EQ), for use with adults of normal intelligence. It contains 40 empathy items and 20 filler/control items. On each empathy item a person can score 2, 1, or 0, so the EQ has a maximum score of 80 and a minimum of zero. In Study 1 we employed the EQ with n = 90 adults (65 males, 25 females) with Asperger Syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA), who are reported clinically to have difficulties in empathy. The adults with AS/HFA scored significantly lower on the EQ than n = 90 (65 males, 25 females) age-matched controls. Of the adults with AS/HFA, 81\% scored equal to or fewer than 30 points out of 80, compared with only 12\% of controls. In Study 2 we carried out a study of n = 197 adults from a general population, to test for previously reported sex differences (female superiority) in empathy. This confirmed that women scored significantly higher than men. The EQ reveals both a sex difference in empathy in the general population and an empathy deficit in AS/HFA.},

  Abstract                 = {Currently there are no brief, self-administered instruments for measuring the degree to which an adult with normal intelligence has the traits associated with the autistic spectrum. In this paper, we report on a new instrument to assess this: the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Individuals score in the range 0-50. Four groups of subjects were assessed: Group 1: 58 adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA); Group 2: 174 randomly selected controls. Group 3: 840 students in Cambridge University; and Group 4: 16 winners of the UK Mathematics Olympiad. The adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ score of 35.8 (SD = 6.5), significantly higher than Group 2 controls (M = 16.4, SD = 6.3). 80\% of the adults with AS/HFA scored 32+, versus 2\% of controls. Among the controls, men scored slightly but significantly higher than women. No women scored extremely highly (AQ score 34+) whereas 4\% of men did so. Twice as many men (40\%) as women (21\%) scored at intermediate levels (AQ score 20+). Among the AS/HFA group, male and female scores did not differ significantly. The students in Cambridge University did not differ from the randomly selected control group, but scientists (including mathematicians) scored significantly higher than both humanities and social sciences students, confirming an earlier study that autistic conditions are associated with scientific skills. Within the sciences, mathematicians scored highest. This was replicated in Group 4, the Mathematics Olympiad winners scoring significantly higher than the male Cambridge humanities students. 6\% of the student sample scored 32+ on the AQ. On interview, 11 out of 11 of these met three or more DSM-IV criteria for AS/HFA, and all were studying sciences/mathematics, and 7 of the 11 met threshold on these criteria. Test-retest and interrater reliability of the AQ was good. The AQ is thus a valuable instrument for rapidly quantifying where any given individual is situated on the continuum from autism to normality. Its potential for screening for autism spectrum conditions in adults of normal intelligence remains to be fully explored.},

  Abstract                 = {Evidence exists linking major depressive disorder (MDD) with clinical cardiovascular events. The importance of the sympathetic nervous system in the generation of cardiac risk in other contexts is established.To examine the importance of the sympathetic nervous system in the generation of cardiac risk in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).Studies were performed in 39 patients meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) criteria for MDD and in 76 healthy subjects. Treatment for patients consisted of selective serotonin reuptake inhibition (SSRI) for 12 weeks. Whole body and cardiac sympathetic activity were examined using noradrenaline isotope dilution methodology and sympathetic nerve recording techniques. Measurement of the extraction of infused tritiated noradrenaline by the heart, and estimation of cardiac dihydroxyphenylglycol production provided direct quantification of neuronal noradrenaline reuptake.Sympathetic activity, particularly in the heart and for the whole body, in patients with MDD followed a bimodal distribution. Elevated values were observed in patients with co-morbid panic disorder (P = 0.006). Consistent with a defect in noradrenaline reuptake, the cardiac extraction of tritiated noradrenaline (0.80 +/- 0.01 versus 0.56 +/- 0.04\%, P < 0.001) and cardiac dihydroxyphenylglycol overflow (109 +/- 8 versus 73 +/- 11, P = 0.01) were reduced in patients with MDD. SSRI therapy abolished the excessive sympathetic activation, with whole body noradrenaline spillover falling from 518 +/- 83 to 290 +/- 41 ng/min (P = 0.008).We have identified a subset of patients with MDD in whom sympathetic nervous activity is extraordinarily high, including in the sympathetic outflow to the heart. Treatment with an SSRI may reduce sympathetic activity in a manner likely to reduce cardiac risk.},

Television pupillometry was used to measure the anticholinergic effects of these drugs on the pupil diameter in darkness and the reflex response to light flashes. The sensitivity of this method was compared with conventional autonomic function tests, viz. salivary secretion, radial pulse, forearm sweat gland activity and distance to visual near point. Visual analogue scales were used to obtain subjective measures of sedative drug effects. The expected inhibition of parasympathetic activity was found in most instances with two exceptions: firstly, that nortriptyline failed to affect the pupil despite causing a tachycardia and secondly, that procyclidine gave a bradycardia.

The precuneus, along with adjacent areas within the posteromedial parietal cortex, is among the most active cortical regions according to the "default mode" of brain function during the conscious resting state, whereas it selectively deactivates in a number of pathophysiological conditions (ie, sleep, vegetative state, drug-induced anesthesia), and neuropsychiatric disorders (ie, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia) characterized by impaired consciousness. These findings, along with the widespread connectivity pattern, suggest that the precuneus may play a central role in the neural network correlates of consciousness. Specifically, its activity seems to correlate with self-reflection processes, possibly involving mental imagery and episodic/autobiographical memory retrieval.},

  Abstract                 = {1. The binocular co-ordination of human vertical saccades was analysed systematically over the full oculomotor range, with a precise and accurate scleral sensor coil technique. Effects of amplitude (1.25-70 deg), direction (upward vs. downward and centripetal vs. centrifugal), as well as position (upper or lower sector of vertical oculomotor range), were investigated systematically in three subjects. 2. All saccades were made voluntarily between continuously presented pairs of targets, which subtended equal angles of target vergence. 3. Vertical saccades were less accurate than horizontal saccades (as described by Collewijn, Erkelens & Steinman, 1988). For target distances between 10 and 70 deg, upward saccades undershot the target by about 10\%, whereas downward saccades tended to overshoot the target. Downward saccades were about 1.5 deg larger than upward saccades between the same targets. 4. Peak velocities continued to increase monotonically with saccadic amplitude up to 513 +/- 27 (S.D.) deg/s for 70 deg saccades; a distinct asymptotic level was not reached. 5. Velocity profiles of upward and downward saccades, made symmetrically about the primary (straight-ahead) position, were very similar for amplitudes up to 30 deg. At larger amplitudes, velocity profiles of upward saccades remained single peaked, whereas those of downward saccades invariably developed a second velocity peak. 6. Parameters of upward saccades depended heavily on the position of the eye. In the upper oculomotor range such saccades had lower maximum speeds, longer durations, and were more skewed than similar saccades in the lower oculomotor range (below primary). Downward saccades were almost independent of eye position. 7. Vertical eye movements during vertical saccades were virtually identical in the two eyes. In contrast, disjunctive horizontal components were systematically present. Upward saccades, at all amplitudes, were associated with diverging eye movements. Converging eye movements occurred during downward saccades. These systematic effects suggest that the vergence subsystem is not turned off during saccades. 8. These changes in vergence were followed by converging horizontal post-saccadic drift after upward saccades, and in diverging horizontal drift after downward saccades.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {The cholinergic hypothesis of affective disorders predicts that mania is a hypocholinergic state relative to monoaminergic activity. Treatments that increase cholinergic sensitivity are expected to improve manic symptoms. Valproic acid is an effective treatment for mania. Little, however, is known about the cholinergic effects of this agent.Ten male hypomanic or manic patients were treated with valproic acid (1500-2000 mg) for 2 weeks. Cholinergic sensitivity was assessed before, and after treatment using graded concentrations of pilocarpine eyedrops (0.03-2.0\%). Pupil size changes were quantified using an infrared pupillometer and ED50 values were referenced to maximal dilation with 0.5\% tropicamide.Valproate treatment decreased Bech mania ratings and ED50 values (p < .0001). Improvements in mania after treatment were closely correlated with decreases in ED50 (r = .76; p < .01). This relationship was indistinguishable from one previously observed after lithium treatment.These results provide support for the cholinergic-adrenergic hypothesis. Moreover, similar pupillary reactions to valproic acid and lithium treatments suggest that these agents may share a common action on muscarinic receptors.},

  Abstract                 = {In the thesis literature review, an engineering graduate student is expected to place original research in the context of previous work by other researchers. However, for some students, particularly those for whom English is a second language, the literature review may be a mixture of original writing and verbatim source text appropriated without quotations. Such problematic use of source material leaves students vulnerable to an accusation of plagiarism, which carries severe consequences. Is such textual appropriation common in engineering master's writing? Furthermore, what, if anything, can be concluded when two texts have been found to have textual material in common? Do existing definitions of plagiarism provide a sufficient framework for determining if an instance of copying is transgressive or not? In a preliminary attempt to answer these questions, text strings from a random sample of 100 engineering master's theses from the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database were searched for appropriated verbatim source text using the Google search engine. The results suggest that textual borrowing may indeed be a common feature of the master's engineering literature review, raising questions about the ability of graduate students to synthesize the literature. The study also illustrates the difficulties of making a determination of plagiarism based on simple textual similarity. A context-specific approach is recommended when dealing with any instance of apparent copying.},

  Abstract                 = {In 19 normal subjects the pupillary reflex to light was studied over a range of stimulus intensities by infrared electronic pupillography and analysed by a computer technique. Increasing stimulus intensity was associated with an increase in direct light reflex amplitude and maximum rate of constriction and redilatation. Latency from stimulus to onset of response-decreased with increasing stimulus intensity. The normal range for each of these parameters is given and the significance of these results in clinical pupillary assessment discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {In Parkinson's disease, together with the classic loss of dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, neuropathological studies and biochemical findings documented the occurrence of a concomitant significant cell death in the locus coeruleus. This review analyzes the latest data obtained from experimental parkinsonism indicating that, the loss of norepinephrine in Parkinson's disease might worsen the dopamine nigrostriatal damage. Within this latter context, basic research provided a new provocative hypothesis on the significance of locus coeruleus in conditioning the natural history of Parkinson's disease. In particular, the loss of a trophic influence of these neurons might be crucial in increasing the sensitivity of nigrostriatal dopamine axons to various neurotoxic insults. In line with this, recently, it has been shown that locus coeruleus activity plays a pivotal role in the expression of various immediate early genes and in inducing the phosphorilation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding proteins, suggesting a role of the nucleus in sustaining a protective effect.},

Also, to assess the extent of the shift from traditional to mixed-effects approaches in published reports in the Archives of General Psychiatry.The Archives of General Psychiatry from 1989 through 2001, and the Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study 425.Studies with a repeated-measures design, at least 2 groups, and a continuous response variable.The first author ranked the studies according to the most advanced statistical method used in the following order: mixed-effects model, rMANOVA, rANOVA, and end-point analysis.The use of mixed-effects models has substantially increased during the last 10 years. In 2001, 30\% of clinical trials reported in the Archives of General Psychiatry used mixed-effects analysis.Repeated-measures ANOVAs continue to be used widely for the analysis of repeated-measures data, despite risks to interpretation. Mixed-effects models use all available data, can properly account for correlation between repeated measurements on the same subject, have greater flexibility to model time effects, and can handle missing data more appropriately. Their flexibility makes them the preferred choice for the analysis of repeated-measures data.},

  Abstract                 = {Humans share with animals a primitive neural system for processing emotions such as fear and anger. Unlike other animals, humans have the unique ability to control and modulate instinctive emotional reactions through intellectual processes such as reasoning, rationalizing, and labeling our experiences. This study used functional MRI to identify the neural networks underlying this ability. Subjects either matched the affect of one of two faces to that of a simultaneously presented target face (a perceptual task) or identified the affect of a target face by choosing one of two simultaneously presented linguistic labels (an intellectual task). Matching angry or frightened expressions was associated with increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the left and right amygdala, the brain's primary fear centers. Labeling these same expressions was associated with a diminished rCBF response in the amygdalae. This decrease correlated with a simultaneous increase in rCBF in the right prefrontal cortex, a neocortical region implicated in regulating emotional responses. These results provide evidence for a network in which higher regions attenuate emotional responses at the most fundamental levels in the brain and suggest a neural basis for modulating emotional experience through interpretation and labeling.},

  Abstract                 = {The cortical circuitry involved in conscious cognitive processes and the subcortical circuitry involved in fear responses have been extensively studied with neuroimaging, but their interactions remain largely unexplored. A recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study demonstrated that the engagement of the right prefrontal cortex during the cognitive evaluation of angry and fearful facial expressions is associated with an attenuation of the response of the amygdala to these same stimuli, providing evidence for a functional neural network for emotional regulation.In the current study, we have explored the generalizability of this functional network by using threatening and fearful non-face stimuli derived from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), as well as the influence of this network on peripheral autonomic responses.Similar to the earlier findings with facial expressions, blood oxygen level dependent fMRI revealed that whereas perceptual processing of IAPS stimuli was associated with a bilateral amygdala response, cognitive evaluation of these same stimuli was associated with attenuation of this amygdala response and a correlated increase in response of the right prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. Moreover, this pattern was reflected in changes in skin conductance.The current results further implicate the importance of neocortical regions, including the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, in regulating emotional responses mediated by the amygdala through conscious evaluation and appraisal.},

  Abstract                 = {Modafinil is a wakefulness-promoting drug which is likely to activate some wakefulness-promoting and/or inhibit sleep-promoting neurones in the brain. The locus coeruleus (LC) is a wakefulness-promoting noradrenergic nucleus whose activity can be "switched off" by the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine, leading to sedative and sympatholytic effects.The aim of the study is to compare the effects of single doses of modafinil and clonidine on arousal and autonomic functions in human volunteers.Sixteen healthy male volunteers participated in four experimental sessions (modafinil 200 mg; clonidine 0.2 mg; modafinil 200 mg + clonidine 0.2 mg; placebo) at weekly intervals, according to a balanced double-blind protocol. Arousal [pupillary "fatigue waves" (PFW), critical flicker fusion frequency, self-ratings of alertness] and autonomic functions (pupil diameter, pupillary light and darkness reflex responses, blood pressure, heart rate, salivation) were recorded. Data were analyzed with ANOVA, with multiple comparisons.Clonidine reduced subjective alertness, pupil diameter, the initial velocity and amplitude of the darkness reflex response, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and salivation, prolonged the recovery time of the light reflex response and increased PFW. Modafinil reduced PFW, increased pupil diameter and the initial velocity of the darkness reflex response and tended to reduce the effect of clonidine on pupil diameter and PFW. Modafinil had no effect on non-pupillary autonomic functions.Clonidine exerted sympatholytic and sedative effects, whereas modafinil had sympathomimetic and some alerting effects. Modafinil may activate noradrenergic neurones in the LC involved in arousal and pupillary control, without affecting extracoerulear noradrenergic neurones involved in cardiovascular and salivary regulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Pupillometry can be used to characterize autonomic drug effects.This study was conducted to determine the autonomic effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy), administered alone and after pretreatment with reboxetine, duloxetine, clonidine, carvedilol, and doxazosin, on pupillary function.Infrared pupillometry was performed in five placebo-controlled randomized studies. Each study included 16 healthy subjects (eight men, eight women) who received placebo-MDMA (125 mg), placebo-placebo, pretreatment-placebo, or pretreatment-MDMA using a crossover design.MDMA produced mydriasis, prolonged the latency, reduced the response to light, and shortened the recovery time. The impaired reflex response was associated with subjective, cardiostimulant, and hyperthermic drug effects and returned to normal within 6 h after MDMA administration when plasma MDMA levels were still high. Mydriasis was associated with changes in plasma MDMA concentration over time and longer-lasting. Both reboxetine and duloxetine interacted with the effects of MDMA on pupillary function. Clonidine did not significantly reduce the mydriatic effects of MDMA, although it produced miosis when administered alone. Carvedilol and doxazosin did not alter the effects of MDMA on pupillary function.The MDMA-induced prolongation of the latency to and reduction of light-induced miosis indicate indirect central parasympathetic inhibition, and the faster recovery time reflects an increased sympathomimetic action. Both norepinephrine and serotonin mediate the effects of MDMA on pupillary function. Although mydriasis is lasting and mirrors the plasma concentration-time curve of MDMA, the impairment in the reaction to light is associated with the subjective and other autonomic effects of MDMA and exhibits acute tolerance.},

  Abstract                 = {Peer review is fundamentally a cooperative process between scientists in a community who agree to review each other's work in an unbiased fashion. Peer review is the foundation for decisions concerning publication in journals, awarding of grants, and academic promotion. Here we perform a laboratory study of open and closed peer review based on an online game. We show that when reviewer behavior was made public under open review, reviewers were rewarded for refereeing and formed significantly more cooperative interactions (13\% increase in cooperation, P = 0.018). We also show that referees and authors who participated in cooperative interactions had an 11\% higher reviewing accuracy rate (P = 0.016). Our results suggest that increasing cooperation in the peer review process can lead to a decreased risk of reviewing errors.},

In nonhuman primates, phasic LC-NE activity confers adaptive adjustments in cortical gain in task-relevant brain networks, and in performance, on a trial-by-trial basis. This model has remained untested in humans. We used the pharmacological agent modafinil to promote low-tonic/high-phasic LC-NE activity in healthy humans performing a cognitive control task during event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Modafanil administration was associated with decreased task-independent, tonic LC activity, increased task-related LC and prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity, and enhanced LC-PFC functional connectivity. These results confirm in humans the role of the LC-NE system in PFC function and cognitive control and suggest a mechanism for therapeutic action of procognitive noradrenergic agents.},

Two recordings were made for each subject: after a full night's sleep, and after 24 hours of sleep deprivation. Several parameters calculated from pupil size and activity were analyzed and compared with a subjective rating of the state of alertness provided by the participants in each test.All pupillary parameters differed significantly between alertness and fatigue (p = 0.0076-0. 0186). Changes in one of the parameters - average pupillary diameter - correlated with changes in the subjective level of sleepiness (r = -0.51, p = 0.028). Although the values of most parameters differed among subjects, an absolute value of more than 25 in one parameter, cumulative pupillary variability ratio, was always associated with sleep deprivation.On-line analysis of the pupillogram using the suggested parameters can be performed easily to produce a real-time assessment of an individual's state of alertness or fatigue that correlates with his/her subjective assessment of this state.},

We evaluated the utility of two candidate psychophysiological markers of LC-NE activity: the P3 event-related potential and pupil diameter. Electroencephalogram and pupillometry data were collected from 24 participants who performed a 37-min auditory oddball task. As predicted by the adaptive gain theory, prestimulus pupil diameter exhibited an inverted U-shaped relationship to P3 and task performance such that largest P3 amplitudes and optimal performance occurred at the same intermediate level of pupil diameter. Large phasic pupil dilations, by contrast, were elicited during periods of poor performance and were followed by reengagement in the task and increased P3 amplitudes. These results support recent proposals that pupil diameter and the P3 are sensitive to LC-NE mode.},

  Abstract                 = {Pupillometry in clinical investigation and in basic research often requires dynamic measurement of pupil size. Static methods, i.e. direct observation and still photography, are often used because of the high cost of commercial infrared pupillometers and problems with pupil-iris contrast in small animals. This report describes an improved infrared video pupillometer (IVP) which accurately measures the pupil area of small animals in real time (30 samples/sec). Two components of the pupillometer were designed and built by the authors: a "bright-pupil" infrared illumination system and a digital video signal processor (VSP). The use of a standard closed-circuit television camera to produce the pupil image signal results in a device that is relatively economical to construct. The IVP is sensitive enough to accurately track pupil are in the study of the pupil light reflex or pupillary oscillations. Several applications for the IVP are illustrated, including analysis of the transient response to light flashes and intravenous injections of drug, and analysis of the spontaneous and drug-induced pupillary fluctuation. Pupillography has been applied in the bioassay of various psychopharmacologic compounds and in the assessment of narcotic dependency. This IVP is being used in this laboratory to study the pupillary action of opiates in the rabbit and rat.},

  Abstract                 = {In biomedical research papers, authors often use descriptive statistics to describe the study sample. The standard deviation (SD) describes the variability between individuals in a sample; the standard error of the mean (SEM) describes the uncertainty of how the sample mean represents the population mean. Authors often, inappropriately, report the SEM when describing the sample. As the SEM is always less than the SD, it misleads the reader into underestimating the variability between individuals within the study sample.The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of inappropriate use of the SEM in four leading anaesthesia journals in 2001. The journals were searched manually for descriptive statistics reporting either the mean (SD) or the mean (SEM), and inappropriate use of the SEM was noted.In 2001, all four anaesthesia journals published articles that used the SEM incorrectly: Anesthesia & Analgesia 27.7\%, British Journal of Anaesthesia 22.6\%, Anesthesiology 18.7\% and European Journal of Anaesthesiology 11.5\%. Laboratory reports and clinical studies were equally affected, except for Anesthesiology where 90\% were basic science reports.One in four articles (n=198/860, 23\%) published in four anaesthesia journals in 2001 inappropriately used the SEM in descriptive statistics to describe the variability of the study sample. Anaesthesia journals are encouraged to provide clearer statistical guidelines on how to report data variability in descriptive statistics.},

  Abstract                 = {Should those who work on ethics welcome or resist moves to open access publishing? This paper analyses arguments in favour and against the increasing requirement for open access publishing and considers their implications for bioethics research. In the context of biomedical science, major funders are increasingly mandating open access as a condition of funding and such moves are also common in other disciplines. Whilst there has been some debate about the implications of open-access for the social sciences and humanities, there has been little if any discussion about the implications of open access for ethics. This is surprising given both the central role of public reason and critique in ethics and the fact that many of the arguments made for and against open access have been couched in moral terms. In what follows I argue that those who work in ethics have a strong interest in supporting moves towards more open publishing approaches which have the potential both to inform and promote richer and more diverse forms of public deliberation and to be enriched by them. The importance of public deliberation in practical and applied ethics suggests that ethicists have a particular interest in the promotion of diverse and experimental forms of publication and debate and in supporting new, more creative and more participatory approaches to publication.},

  Abstract                 = {PsychoPy is a software library written in Python, using OpenGL to generate very precise visual stimuli on standard personal computers. It is designed to allow the construction of as wide a variety of neuroscience experiments as possible, with the least effort. By writing scripts in standard Python syntax users can generate an enormous variety of visual and auditory stimuli and can interact with a wide range of external hardware (enabling its use in fMRI, EEG, MEG etc.). The structure of scripts is simple and intuitive. As a result, new experiments can be written very quickly, and trying to understand a previously written script is easy, even with minimal code comments. PsychoPy can also generate movies and image sequences to be used in demos or simulated neuroscience experiments. This paper describes the range of tools and stimuli that it provides and the environment in which experiments are conducted.},

  Abstract                 = {Spontaneous fluctuations in the size of the pupil in darkness are a recognized index of sleepiness, and these fluctuations can be quantitatively measured using the pupillographic sleepiness test (PST). The central noradrenergic system is believed to play a role in the maintenance of alertness, and there is evidence that alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists (e.g. clonidine) decrease the activity of central noradrenergic neurones, whereas alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists (e.g. yohimbine) have the opposite effect.To evaluate the effects of single oral doses of clonidine and yohimbine on spontaneous pupillary fluctuations in healthy volunteers.Sixteen healthy male volunteers (18-25 years) participated in four weekly sessions, each associated with one oral drug condition (clonidine hydrochloride 0.2 mg, yohimbine hydrochloride 22 mg, clonidine hydrochloride 0.2 mg + yohimbine hydrochloride 22 mg), according to a balanced double-blind design. Pupil diameter was recorded continuously over 11 min in darkness using a dedicated monocular video pupillometer. Average pupil diameter, power of pupil diameter fluctuations (obtained by fast Fourier transformation), and the pupillary unrest index (PUI), a measure of cumulative changes in pupil size, were computed. Autonomic functions known to be sensitive to centrally acting noradrenergic drugs (blood pressure, heart rate and salivary output) were recorded. Subjective "alertness", "anxiety" and "contentedness" were rated using visual analogue scales. Measurements were carried out 2 h after drug ingestion. Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's corrected t-test (criterion of significance P < 0.05).Clonidine decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, salivation and subjectively rated alertness, and tended to decrease pupil diameter, and to increase the power of pupillary fluctuations and PUI. On the other hand, yohimbine increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, salivation, pupil diameter and decreased PUI. When the two drugs were given in combination they reduced each other's effects.These results confirm the alerting effect of the centrally acting noradrenergic activating drug yohimbine and the opposite effect of clonidine, and the suitability of the PST to detect these effects.},

  Abstract                 = {The P300 wave is a positive deflection in the human event-related potential. It is most commonly elicited in an "oddball" paradigm when a subject detects an occasional "target" stimulus in a regular train of standard stimuli. The P300 wave only occurs if the subject is actively engaged in the task of detecting the targets. Its amplitude varies with the improbability of the targets. Its latency varies with the difficulty of discriminating the target stimulus from the standard stimuli. A typical peak latency when a young adult subject makes a simple discrimination is 300 ms. In patients with decreased cognitive ability, the P300 is smaller and later than in age-matched normal subjects. The intracerebral origin of the P300 wave is not known and its role in cognition not clearly understood. The P300 may have multiple intracerebral generators, with the hippocampus and various association areas of the neocortex all contributing to the scalp-recorded potential. The P300 wave may represent the transfer of information to consciousness, a process that involves many different regions of the brain.},

  Abstract                 = {Our decisions are guided by the rewards we expect. These expectations are often based on incomplete knowledge and are thus subject to uncertainty. While the neurophysiology of expected rewards is well understood, less is known about the physiology of uncertainty. We hypothesize that uncertainty, or more specifically errors in judging uncertainty, are reflected in pupil dilation, a marker that has frequently been associated with decision making, but so far has remained largely elusive to quantitative models. To test this hypothesis, we measure pupil dilation while observers perform an auditory gambling task. This task dissociates two key decision variables - uncertainty and reward - and their errors from each other and from the act of the decision itself. We first demonstrate that the pupil does not signal expected reward or uncertainty per se, but instead signals surprise, that is, errors in judging uncertainty. While this general finding is independent of the precise quantification of these decision variables, we then analyze this effect with respect to a specific mathematical model of uncertainty and surprise, namely risk and risk prediction error. Using this quantification, we find that pupil dilation and risk prediction error are indeed highly correlated. Under the assumption of a tight link between noradrenaline (NA) and pupil size under constant illumination, our data may be interpreted as empirical evidence for the hypothesis that NA plays a similar role for uncertainty as dopamine does for reward, namely the encoding of error signals.},

  Abstract                 = {Impulse activity of individual neurons in the nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) was recorded from chair-restrained, unanesthetized cynomolgus monkeys. LC activity was closely related to the behavioral state of the animal. In alert waking, LC neurons displayed continuous, moderately irregular activity. In contrast, prolonged pauses in activity accompanied drowsiness. These pauses preceded eye closure and occurred 1-3 s before the onset of slow-wave EEG. At awakening, LC activation preceded by up to 3 s desynchronized EEG and eye opening. LC activity during alertness varied tonically. During behavioral agitation LC activity was higher than during goal-directed task behavior (described below). In addition to these changes in tonic activity, LC neurons were also phasically responsive to certain sensory stimuli. These cells responded selectively to unexpected, meaningful sounds. LC neurons were also recorded during a visual oddball discrimination task in which the monkey was required to selectively release a lever in response to an infrequent visual cue (target cue; CS+) to receive juice reward. LC neurons were selectively activated by CS+ cues in this task; no other task events evoked LC activity. The mean latency of CS+ response was 108 ms (90 ms for multicell recordings), more than 150 ms prior to the behavioral response (lever release). These responses became smaller in later epochs during the session, along with deteriorating task performance. It is proposed that these short-lasting stimulus-evoked LC responses may help optimize behavioral responses and increase vigilance to subsequent sensory stimuli. Together, LC may contribute both to maintaining tonic levels of vigilance and to phasically modulating the current vigilance level in a stimulus-dependent mode.},

The results of an experiment confirmed the model's predictive ability. An alternative hypothesis, which is based on facial configural information, failed to provide an efficient explanation for these findings, as the proposed model does. The model shows how components of first-order relational properties are mathematically integrated and involved in face processing.},

  Abstract                 = {The locus coeruleus (LC), the major noradrenergic nucleus of the brain, gives rise to fibres innervating most structures of the neuraxis. Recent advances in neuroscience have helped to unravel the neuronal circuitry controlling a number of physiological functions in which the LC plays a central role. Two such functions are the regulation of arousal and autonomic activity, which are inseparably linked largely via the involvement of the LC. Alterations in LC activity due to physiological or pharmacological manipulations or pathological processes can lead to distinct patterns of change in arousal and autonomic function. Physiological manipulations considered here include the presentation of noxious or anxiety-provoking stimuli and extremes in ambient temperature. The modification of LC-controlled functions by drug administration is discussed in detail, including drugs which directly modify the activity of LC neurones (e.g., via autoreceptors, storage, reuptake) or have an indirect effect through modulating excitatory or inhibitory inputs. The early vulnerability of the LC to the ageing process and to neurodegenerative disease (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases) is of considerable clinical significance. In general, physiological manipulations and the administration of stimulant drugs, alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists and noradrenaline uptake inhibitors increase LC activity and thus cause heightened arousal and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. In contrast, the administration of sedative drugs, including alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists, and pathological changes in LC function in neurodegenerative disorders and ageing reduce LC activity and result in sedation and activation of the parasympathetic nervous system.},

Drug potency was obtained from dose response curves. 2. The tertiary amines arecoline, aceclidine and pilocarpine were considerably more effective miotics than the choline esters carbachol, methacholine and acetylcholine. 3. All the drugs which caused miosis also reduced light reflex amplitude proportionally. 4. The in vitro potency of these drugs was also measured on preparations of rabbit iris sphincter and guinea pig ileum. 5. Dose response relationships for pilocarpine in man and in vitro showed evidence of partial agonist activity on the rabbit iris only. 6. A comparison of the in vivo and in vitro results showed that three factors influenced the potency of topically applied miotics: accessibility to the iris; sensitivity to cholinesterase; and cholinoceptor agonist potency.},

The SE reflects the variability of the mean values, as if the study were repeated a large number of times. By itself, the SE is not particularly useful; however, it is used in constructing 95\% and 99\% confidence intervals (CIs), which indicate a range of values within which the "true" value lies. The CI shows the reader how accurate the estimates of the population values actually are. If graphs are used, error bars equal to plus and minus 2 SEs (which show the 95\% CI) should be drawn around mean values. Both statistical significance testing and CIs are useful because they assist the reader in determining the meaning of the findings.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Three experiments were conducted to examine whether mydriatic or miotic drugs instilled into one eye have any effect on the diameter of the pupil of the untreated fellow eye, in healthy volunteers. 2. In Experiment 1, the effects of four subjects, using photography in an illuminated room to assess pupil diameter. The drug evoked a dose-dependent mydriasis in the index eye which was accompanied by a simultaneous dose-dependent miosis in the fellow eye. 3. In Experiment 2, the same method was used to assess pupil diameter as in Experiment 1. The effects of mydriatic (methoxamine and tyramine) and of miotic (pilocarpine) drugs instilled into the fellow eye, were studied on the sizes of pupillary responses to the same drugs instilled into the index eye. The presence of a mydriatic drug in the fellow eye resulted in a decrease in the size of the mydriatic responses in the index eye. 4. In Experiment 3, the effects of three concentrations of phenylephrine hydrochloride (0.15-0.60 M) and of three concentrations of pilocarpine hydrochloride (0.002-0.008 M), were studied in darkness using an infra-red binocular television pupillometer, in seven subjects. Phenylephrine evoked dose-dependent mydriasis and pilocarpine evoked dose-dependent miosis. The pupillary responses of the index eye were not accompanied by any changes in the diameter of the pupil of the fellow eye. 5.

DAergic cell populations in the mesencephalon (SN pars compacta, VTA, and the retrorubral area A8) which give rise to well-developed, DAergic, mesotelencephalic pathways, including a distinct mesostriatal system, and a substance P-immunoreactive striatotegmental system which projects to the SN pars reticulata and VTA appear to be common to reptiles, birds, and mammals (Sect. 3.1). The extensive literature on the organization of the SN/VTA complex in rats is summarized in Sect. 3.2. The mesotelencephalic projection is organized along inverted dorsal to ventral, medial to lateral, and rostral to caudal topographies. A dense DAergic innervation is characteristic of the entire striatal complex, including the caudate-putamen (the dorsal striatum), the nucleus accumbens, and the olfactory tubercle (the ventral striatum). This mesostriatal projection is compartmentally organized with distinct sets of DAergic neurons projecting to striosomes and extrasriosomal matrix, respectively, suggesting specialized channels directed at DAergic modulation of sensorimotor processing in the striatal matrix and limbic related mechanisms represented in the striosomal system. The VTA and medial part of the SN give rise to the DAergic mesolimbocortical system with extensive projections to limbic, allocortical, and neocortical structures. The striatonigral output pattern in rats is organized in such a way that the dorsal striatum mainly innervates the SN pars reticulata, whereas the ventral striatum projects predominantly to the VTA and medial part of the SN. Within the striatonigral projections in rats some interesting channels can be recognized, relating the sensorimotor cortex, via its corticostriatal projections, to that region of the SN giving rise to the nigrothalamic projection, and the visual cortex to the nigrotectal component of the SN pars reticulata.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {Based on studies of depression and anxiety using animal (rat) models, it is suggested that, contrary to a widely accepted theory, increased activity of locus coeruleus (LC) neurons does not appear to potentiate anxiety; instead, the influence of LC activity may be opposite to this. First, studies are described that indicate that behavioral changes resembling what is seen in human clinical depression occur in rats exposed to highly stressful conditions, and the research is then traced, which links this stress-induced depression to disturbance of normal noradrenergic regulation of LC activity. Second, the potential role of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) in stress-induced behavioral depression is explored. CRF infused into the LC did not produce behavioral depression in the swim test but did increase anxiety; by comparison, CRF infused into the parabrachial nucleus lateral to LC increased both depression and anxiety. Finally, to further explore the relationship between LC activity and anxiety, drugs were infused into LC region to attempt to specifically activate or depress firing of LC neurons. In contrast to expectations, infusion to decrease firing of LC cells increased anxious behavior, while infusion to increase firing decreased anxious behavior. Several other studies are discussed that point to a similar conclusion. It is suggested that, at least in rats, the capacity of stress-inducing or aversive stimuli to activate LC neurons does not potentiate anxiety under environmental conditions that elicit this response, but, rather, the increased activity of the LC/dorsal noradrenergic system under such conditions may exert a counterbalancing, antianxiety influence.},

  Abstract                 = {Muscarinic receptors present in cultured human iris sphincter and ciliary smooth muscle cells were characterized by both ligand ([3H]QNB binding) and functional (phosphoinositide hydrolysis) studies. Ligand binding studies showed that [3H]QNB represented a single population of binding sites with KD values of 4.02 x 10(-11) M in the ciliary and 5.6 x 10(-11) M in the iris sphincter cells. In competition studies, the selective antagonist, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methobromide (4-DAMP) was the most potent in displacing [3H]QNB with selectivity of 150-350-fold over pirenzepine (M1) and 450-1700-fold over AF-DX 116 (M2). 4-DAMP recognized one site in the iris sphincter cells (Ki = 0.34 nM) but two sites in the ciliary cells (KH = 0.9 nM and KL = 49 nM). 4-DAMP was also the most potent in inhibiting carbachol-induced hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids (PI) in both cell types. However, the IC50 values for PI hydrolysis were several fold lower than those for [3H]QNB binding. Using these selective antagonists, our data supports the presence of functional muscarinic receptors of M3 subtype in human iris sphincter and ciliary cells. It also shows the presence of a second low affinity site in the ciliary smooth muscle cells that is recognized by 4-DAMP.},

  Abstract                 = {To investigate the pattern of innervation in the human iris dilator muscle, effects of field stimulation on the isometric tension of dilator muscle were investigated in vitro. Throughout the experiments, spontaneous contractions did not occur. Application of repetitive field stimulations evoked biphasic mechanical responses (i.e. an initial phasic contraction followed by long lasting relaxation) of the isolated human iris dilator. These mechanical responses were abolished by 10(-7) M tetrodotoxin (a nerve poison), thereby indicating that the mechanical responses were neurogenic. Furthermore, the initial phasic contractions and following muscle relaxation were selectively blocked by phentolamine (10(-5) M) and atropine (10(-5) M), respectively. The degree of the muscle relaxation to that of contraction was much larger than that assumed by other investigators who used tissues from different species. The present results indicate that the human iris dilator muscle is innervated by adrenergic excitatory and cholinergic inhibitory nerves, and that cholinergic inhibitory innervations in this muscle may support the cholinergic miosis in the iris sphincter muscle.},
