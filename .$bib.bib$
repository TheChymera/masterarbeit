  Abstract                 = {Systemizing is the drive to analyse systems or construct systems. A recent model of psychological sex differences suggests that this is a major dimension in which the sexes differ, with males being more drawn to systemize than females. Currently, there are no self-report measures to assess this important dimension. A second major dimension of sex differences is empathizing (the drive to identify mental states and respond to these with an appropriate emotion). Previous studies find females score higher on empathy measures. We report a new self-report questionnaire, the Systemizing Quotient (SQ), for use with adults of normal intelligence. It contains 40 systemizing items and 20 control items. On each systemizing item, a person can score 2, 1 or 0, so the SQ has a maximum score of 80 and a minimum of zero. In Study 1, we measured the SQ of n = 278 adults (114 males, 164 females) from a general population, to test for predicted sex differences (male superiority) in systemizing. All subjects were also given the Empathy Quotient (EQ) to test if previous reports of female superiority would be replicated. In Study 2 we employed the SQ and the EQ with n = 47 adults (33 males, 14 females) with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA), who are predicted to be either normal or superior at systemizing, but impaired at empathizing. Their scores were compared with n = 47 matched adults from the general population in Study 1. In Study 1, as predicted, normal adult males scored significantly higher than females on the SQ and significantly lower on the EQ. In Study 2, again as predicted, adults with AS/HFA scored significantly higher on the SQ than matched controls, and significantly lower on the EQ than matched controls. The SQ reveals both a sex difference in systemizing in the general population and an unusually strong drive to systemize in AS/HFA. These results are discussed in relation to two linked theories: the 'empathizing-systemizing' (E-S) theory of sex differences and the extreme male brain (EMB) theory of autism.},

  Abstract                 = {Empathy is an essential part of normal social functioning, yet there are precious few instruments for measuring individual differences in this domain. In this article we review psychological theories of empathy and its measurement. Previous instruments that purport to measure this have not always focused purely on empathy. We report a new self-report questionnaire, the Empathy Quotient (EQ), for use with adults of normal intelligence. It contains 40 empathy items and 20 filler/control items. On each empathy item a person can score 2, 1, or 0, so the EQ has a maximum score of 80 and a minimum of zero. In Study 1 we employed the EQ with n = 90 adults (65 males, 25 females) with Asperger Syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA), who are reported clinically to have difficulties in empathy. The adults with AS/HFA scored significantly lower on the EQ than n = 90 (65 males, 25 females) age-matched controls. Of the adults with AS/HFA, 81\% scored equal to or fewer than 30 points out of 80, compared with only 12\% of controls. In Study 2 we carried out a study of n = 197 adults from a general population, to test for previously reported sex differences (female superiority) in empathy. This confirmed that women scored significantly higher than men. The EQ reveals both a sex difference in empathy in the general population and an empathy deficit in AS/HFA.},

  Abstract                 = {Currently there are no brief, self-administered instruments for measuring the degree to which an adult with normal intelligence has the traits associated with the autistic spectrum. In this paper, we report on a new instrument to assess this: the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Individuals score in the range 0-50. Four groups of subjects were assessed: Group 1: 58 adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA); Group 2: 174 randomly selected controls. Group 3: 840 students in Cambridge University; and Group 4: 16 winners of the UK Mathematics Olympiad. The adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ score of 35.8 (SD = 6.5), significantly higher than Group 2 controls (M = 16.4, SD = 6.3). 80\% of the adults with AS/HFA scored 32+, versus 2\% of controls. Among the controls, men scored slightly but significantly higher than women. No women scored extremely highly (AQ score 34+) whereas 4\% of men did so. Twice as many men (40\%) as women (21\%) scored at intermediate levels (AQ score 20+). Among the AS/HFA group, male and female scores did not differ significantly. The students in Cambridge University did not differ from the randomly selected control group, but scientists (including mathematicians) scored significantly higher than both humanities and social sciences students, confirming an earlier study that autistic conditions are associated with scientific skills. Within the sciences, mathematicians scored highest. This was replicated in Group 4, the Mathematics Olympiad winners scoring significantly higher than the male Cambridge humanities students. 6\% of the student sample scored 32+ on the AQ. On interview, 11 out of 11 of these met three or more DSM-IV criteria for AS/HFA, and all were studying sciences/mathematics, and 7 of the 11 met threshold on these criteria. Test-retest and interrater reliability of the AQ was good. The AQ is thus a valuable instrument for rapidly quantifying where any given individual is situated on the continuum from autism to normality. Its potential for screening for autism spectrum conditions in adults of normal intelligence remains to be fully explored.},

Television pupillometry was used to measure the anticholinergic effects of these drugs on the pupil diameter in darkness and the reflex response to light flashes. The sensitivity of this method was compared with conventional autonomic function tests, viz. salivary secretion, radial pulse, forearm sweat gland activity and distance to visual near point. Visual analogue scales were used to obtain subjective measures of sedative drug effects. The expected inhibition of parasympathetic activity was found in most instances with two exceptions: firstly, that nortriptyline failed to affect the pupil despite causing a tachycardia and secondly, that procyclidine gave a bradycardia. The results are discussed with reference to the possible advantages of television pupillometry over conventional pupil measurement in the detection of anticholinergic drug effects.},

  Abstract                 = {1. The binocular co-ordination of human vertical saccades was analysed systematically over the full oculomotor range, with a precise and accurate scleral sensor coil technique. Effects of amplitude (1.25-70 deg), direction (upward vs. downward and centripetal vs. centrifugal), as well as position (upper or lower sector of vertical oculomotor range), were investigated systematically in three subjects. 2. All saccades were made voluntarily between continuously presented pairs of targets, which subtended equal angles of target vergence. 3. Vertical saccades were less accurate than horizontal saccades (as described by Collewijn, Erkelens & Steinman, 1988). For target distances between 10 and 70 deg, upward saccades undershot the target by about 10\%, whereas downward saccades tended to overshoot the target. Downward saccades were about 1.5 deg larger than upward saccades between the same targets. 4. Peak velocities continued to increase monotonically with saccadic amplitude up to 513 +/- 27 (S.D.) deg/s for 70 deg saccades; a distinct asymptotic level was not reached. 5. Velocity profiles of upward and downward saccades, made symmetrically about the primary (straight-ahead) position, were very similar for amplitudes up to 30 deg. At larger amplitudes, velocity profiles of upward saccades remained single peaked, whereas those of downward saccades invariably developed a second velocity peak. 6. Parameters of upward saccades depended heavily on the position of the eye. In the upper oculomotor range such saccades had lower maximum speeds, longer durations, and were more skewed than similar saccades in the lower oculomotor range (below primary). Downward saccades were almost independent of eye position. 7. Vertical eye movements during vertical saccades were virtually identical in the two eyes. In contrast, disjunctive horizontal components were systematically present. Upward saccades, at all amplitudes, were associated with diverging eye movements. Converging eye movements occurred during downward saccades. These systematic effects suggest that the vergence subsystem is not turned off during saccades. 8. These changes in vergence were followed by converging horizontal post-saccadic drift after upward saccades, and in diverging horizontal drift after downward saccades.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {In the thesis literature review, an engineering graduate student is expected to place original research in the context of previous work by other researchers. However, for some students, particularly those for whom English is a second language, the literature review may be a mixture of original writing and verbatim source text appropriated without quotations. Such problematic use of source material leaves students vulnerable to an accusation of plagiarism, which carries severe consequences. Is such textual appropriation common in engineering master's writing? Furthermore, what, if anything, can be concluded when two texts have been found to have textual material in common? Do existing definitions of plagiarism provide a sufficient framework for determining if an instance of copying is transgressive or not? In a preliminary attempt to answer these questions, text strings from a random sample of 100 engineering master's theses from the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database were searched for appropriated verbatim source text using the Google search engine. The results suggest that textual borrowing may indeed be a common feature of the master's engineering literature review, raising questions about the ability of graduate students to synthesize the literature. The study also illustrates the difficulties of making a determination of plagiarism based on simple textual similarity. A context-specific approach is recommended when dealing with any instance of apparent copying.},

Study 3 shows that reappraisers experience and express greater positive emotion and lesser negative emotion, whereas suppressors experience and express lesser positive emotion, yet experience greater negative emotion. Study 4 indicates that using reappraisal is associated with better interpersonal functioning, whereas using suppression is associated with worse interpersonal functioning.

In 2001, 30\% of clinical trials reported in the Archives of General Psychiatry used mixed-effects analysis.Repeated-measures ANOVAs continue to be used widely for the analysis of repeated-measures data, despite risks to interpretation. Mixed-effects models use all available data, can properly account for correlation between repeated measurements on the same subject, have greater flexibility to model time effects, and can handle missing data more appropriately. Their flexibility makes them the preferred choice for the analysis of repeated-measures data.},

  Abstract                 = {Humans share with animals a primitive neural system for processing emotions such as fear and anger. Unlike other animals, humans have the unique ability to control and modulate instinctive emotional reactions through intellectual processes such as reasoning, rationalizing, and labeling our experiences. This study used functional MRI to identify the neural networks underlying this ability. Subjects either matched the affect of one of two faces to that of a simultaneously presented target face (a perceptual task) or identified the affect of a target face by choosing one of two simultaneously presented linguistic labels (an intellectual task). Matching angry or frightened expressions was associated with increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the left and right amygdala, the brain's primary fear centers. Labeling these same expressions was associated with a diminished rCBF response in the amygdalae. This decrease correlated with a simultaneous increase in rCBF in the right prefrontal cortex, a neocortical region implicated in regulating emotional responses. These results provide evidence for a network in which higher regions attenuate emotional responses at the most fundamental levels in the brain and suggest a neural basis for modulating emotional experience through interpretation and labeling.},

  Abstract                 = {The cortical circuitry involved in conscious cognitive processes and the subcortical circuitry involved in fear responses have been extensively studied with neuroimaging, but their interactions remain largely unexplored. A recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study demonstrated that the engagement of the right prefrontal cortex during the cognitive evaluation of angry and fearful facial expressions is associated with an attenuation of the response of the amygdala to these same stimuli, providing evidence for a functional neural network for emotional regulation.In the current study, we have explored the generalizability of this functional network by using threatening and fearful non-face stimuli derived from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), as well as the influence of this network on peripheral autonomic responses.Similar to the earlier findings with facial expressions, blood oxygen level dependent fMRI revealed that whereas perceptual processing of IAPS stimuli was associated with a bilateral amygdala response, cognitive evaluation of these same stimuli was associated with attenuation of this amygdala response and a correlated increase in response of the right prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. Moreover, this pattern was reflected in changes in skin conductance.The current results further implicate the importance of neocortical regions, including the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, in regulating emotional responses mediated by the amygdala through conscious evaluation and appraisal.},

  Abstract                 = {Pupillometry can be used to characterize autonomic drug effects.This study was conducted to determine the autonomic effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy), administered alone and after pretreatment with reboxetine, duloxetine, clonidine, carvedilol, and doxazosin, on pupillary function.Infrared pupillometry was performed in five placebo-controlled randomized studies. Each study included 16 healthy subjects (eight men, eight women) who received placebo-MDMA (125 mg), placebo-placebo, pretreatment-placebo, or pretreatment-MDMA using a crossover design.MDMA produced mydriasis, prolonged the latency, reduced the response to light, and shortened the recovery time. The impaired reflex response was associated with subjective, cardiostimulant, and hyperthermic drug effects and returned to normal within 6 h after MDMA administration when plasma MDMA levels were still high. Mydriasis was associated with changes in plasma MDMA concentration over time and longer-lasting. Both reboxetine and duloxetine interacted with the effects of MDMA on pupillary function. Clonidine did not significantly reduce the mydriatic effects of MDMA, although it produced miosis when administered alone. Carvedilol and doxazosin did not alter the effects of MDMA on pupillary function.The MDMA-induced prolongation of the latency to and reduction of light-induced miosis indicate indirect central parasympathetic inhibition, and the faster recovery time reflects an increased sympathomimetic action. Both norepinephrine and serotonin mediate the effects of MDMA on pupillary function. Although mydriasis is lasting and mirrors the plasma concentration-time curve of MDMA, the impairment in the reaction to light is associated with the subjective and other autonomic effects of MDMA and exhibits acute tolerance.},

Peer review is the foundation for decisions concerning publication in journals, awarding of grants, and academic promotion. Here we perform a laboratory study of open and closed peer review based on an online game. We show that when reviewer behavior was made public under open review, reviewers were rewarded for refereeing and formed significantly more cooperative interactions (13\% increase in cooperation, P = 0.018). We also show that referees and authors who participated in cooperative interactions had an 11\% higher reviewing accuracy rate (P = 0.016). Our results suggest that increasing cooperation in the peer review process can lead to a decreased risk of reviewing errors.},

Two recordings were made for each subject: after a full night's sleep, and after 24 hours of sleep deprivation. Several parameters calculated from pupil size and activity were analyzed and compared with a subjective rating of the state of alertness provided by the participants in each test.All pupillary parameters differed significantly between alertness and fatigue (p = 0.0076-0. 0186). Changes in one of the parameters - average pupillary diameter - correlated with changes in the subjective level of sleepiness (r = -0.51, p = 0.028). Although the values of most parameters differed among subjects, an absolute value of more than 25 in one parameter, cumulative pupillary variability ratio, was always associated with sleep deprivation.On-line analysis of the pupillogram using the suggested parameters can be performed easily to produce a real-time assessment of an individual's state of alertness or fatigue that correlates with his/her subjective assessment of this state.},

  Abstract                 = {In biomedical research papers, authors often use descriptive statistics to describe the study sample. The standard deviation (SD) describes the variability between individuals in a sample; the standard error of the mean (SEM) describes the uncertainty of how the sample mean represents the population mean. Authors often, inappropriately, report the SEM when describing the sample. As the SEM is always less than the SD, it misleads the reader into underestimating the variability between individuals within the study sample.The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of inappropriate use of the SEM in four leading anaesthesia journals in 2001. The journals were searched manually for descriptive statistics reporting either the mean (SD) or the mean (SEM), and inappropriate use of the SEM was noted.In 2001, all four anaesthesia journals published articles that used the SEM incorrectly: Anesthesia & Analgesia 27.7\%, British Journal of Anaesthesia 22.6\%, Anesthesiology 18.7\% and European Journal of Anaesthesiology 11.5\%. Laboratory reports and clinical studies were equally affected, except for Anesthesiology where 90\% were basic science reports.One in four articles (n=198/860, 23\%) published in four anaesthesia journals in 2001 inappropriately used the SEM in descriptive statistics to describe the variability of the study sample. Anaesthesia journals are encouraged to provide clearer statistical guidelines on how to report data variability in descriptive statistics.},

  Abstract                 = {Should those who work on ethics welcome or resist moves to open access publishing? This paper analyses arguments in favour and against the increasing requirement for open access publishing and considers their implications for bioethics research. In the context of biomedical science, major funders are increasingly mandating open access as a condition of funding and such moves are also common in other disciplines. Whilst there has been some debate about the implications of open-access for the social sciences and humanities, there has been little if any discussion about the implications of open access for ethics. This is surprising given both the central role of public reason and critique in ethics and the fact that many of the arguments made for and against open access have been couched in moral terms. In what follows I argue that those who work in ethics have a strong interest in supporting moves towards more open publishing approaches which have the potential both to inform and promote richer and more diverse forms of public deliberation and to be enriched by them. The importance of public deliberation in practical and applied ethics suggests that ethicists have a particular interest in the promotion of diverse and experimental forms of publication and debate and in supporting new, more creative and more participatory approaches to publication.},

  Abstract                 = {PsychoPy is a software library written in Python, using OpenGL to generate very precise visual stimuli on standard personal computers. It is designed to allow the construction of as wide a variety of neuroscience experiments as possible, with the least effort. By writing scripts in standard Python syntax users can generate an enormous variety of visual and auditory stimuli and can interact with a wide range of external hardware (enabling its use in fMRI, EEG, MEG etc.). The structure of scripts is simple and intuitive. As a result, new experiments can be written very quickly, and trying to understand a previously written script is easy, even with minimal code comments. PsychoPy can also generate movies and image sequences to be used in demos or simulated neuroscience experiments. This paper describes the range of tools and stimuli that it provides and the environment in which experiments are conducted.},

  Abstract                 = {Spontaneous fluctuations in the size of the pupil in darkness are a recognized index of sleepiness, and these fluctuations can be quantitatively measured using the pupillographic sleepiness test (PST). The central noradrenergic system is believed to play a role in the maintenance of alertness, and there is evidence that alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists (e.g. clonidine) decrease the activity of central noradrenergic neurones, whereas alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists (e.g. yohimbine) have the opposite effect.To evaluate the effects of single oral doses of clonidine and yohimbine on spontaneous pupillary fluctuations in healthy volunteers.Sixteen healthy male volunteers (18-25 years) participated in four weekly sessions, each associated with one oral drug condition (clonidine hydrochloride 0.2 mg, yohimbine hydrochloride 22 mg, clonidine hydrochloride 0.2 mg + yohimbine hydrochloride 22 mg), according to a balanced double-blind design. Pupil diameter was recorded continuously over 11 min in darkness using a dedicated monocular video pupillometer. Average pupil diameter, power of pupil diameter fluctuations (obtained by fast Fourier transformation), and the pupillary unrest index (PUI), a measure of cumulative changes in pupil size, were computed. Autonomic functions known to be sensitive to centrally acting noradrenergic drugs (blood pressure, heart rate and salivary output) were recorded. Subjective "alertness", "anxiety" and "contentedness" were rated using visual analogue scales. Measurements were carried out 2 h after drug ingestion. Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's corrected t-test (criterion of significance P < 0.05).Clonidine decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, salivation and subjectively rated alertness, and tended to decrease pupil diameter, and to increase the power of pupillary fluctuations and PUI. On the other hand, yohimbine increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, salivation, pupil diameter and decreased PUI. When the two drugs were given in combination they reduced each other's effects.These results confirm the alerting effect of the centrally acting noradrenergic activating drug yohimbine and the opposite effect of clonidine, and the suitability of the PST to detect these effects.},

  Abstract                 = {Our decisions are guided by the rewards we expect. These expectations are often based on incomplete knowledge and are thus subject to uncertainty. While the neurophysiology of expected rewards is well understood, less is known about the physiology of uncertainty. We hypothesize that uncertainty, or more specifically errors in judging uncertainty, are reflected in pupil dilation, a marker that has frequently been associated with decision making, but so far has remained largely elusive to quantitative models. To test this hypothesis, we measure pupil dilation while observers perform an auditory gambling task. This task dissociates two key decision variables - uncertainty and reward - and their errors from each other and from the act of the decision itself. We first demonstrate that the pupil does not signal expected reward or uncertainty per se, but instead signals surprise, that is, errors in judging uncertainty. While this general finding is independent of the precise quantification of these decision variables, we then analyze this effect with respect to a specific mathematical model of uncertainty and surprise, namely risk and risk prediction error. Using this quantification, we find that pupil dilation and risk prediction error are indeed highly correlated. Under the assumption of a tight link between noradrenaline (NA) and pupil size under constant illumination, our data may be interpreted as empirical evidence for the hypothesis that NA plays a similar role for uncertainty as dopamine does for reward, namely the encoding of error signals.},

The CI shows the reader how accurate the estimates of the population values actually are. If graphs are used, error bars equal to plus and minus 2 SEs (which show the 95\% CI) should be drawn around mean values.

  Abstract                 = {1. Three experiments were conducted to examine whether mydriatic or miotic drugs instilled into one eye have any effect on the diameter of the pupil of the untreated fellow eye, in healthy volunteers. 2. In Experiment 1, the effects of four subjects, using photography in an illuminated room to assess pupil diameter. The drug evoked a dose-dependent mydriasis in the index eye which was accompanied by a simultaneous dose-dependent miosis in the fellow eye. 3. In Experiment 2, the same method was used to assess pupil diameter as in Experiment 1. The effects of mydriatic (methoxamine and tyramine) and of miotic (pilocarpine) drugs instilled into the fellow eye, were studied on the sizes of pupillary responses to the same drugs instilled into the index eye. The presence of a mydriatic drug in the fellow eye resulted in a decrease in the size of the mydriatic responses in the index eye. 4. In Experiment 3, the effects of three concentrations of phenylephrine hydrochloride (0.15-0.60 M) and of three concentrations of pilocarpine hydrochloride (0.002-0.008 M), were studied in darkness using an infra-red binocular television pupillometer, in seven subjects. Phenylephrine evoked dose-dependent mydriasis and pilocarpine evoked dose-dependent miosis. The pupillary responses of the index eye were not accompanied by any changes in the diameter of the pupil of the fellow eye. 5. It is concluded that drug-induced mydriasis in the index eye is accompanied by a consensual miosis in the fellow eye.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  Abstract                 = {Muscarinic receptors present in cultured human iris sphincter and ciliary smooth muscle cells were characterized by both ligand ([3H]QNB binding) and functional (phosphoinositide hydrolysis) studies. Ligand binding studies showed that [3H]QNB represented a single population of binding sites with KD values of 4.02 x 10(-11) M in the ciliary and 5.6 x 10(-11) M in the iris sphincter cells. In competition studies, the selective antagonist, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methobromide (4-DAMP) was the most potent in displacing [3H]QNB with selectivity of 150-350-fold over pirenzepine (M1) and 450-1700-fold over AF-DX 116 (M2). 4-DAMP recognized one site in the iris sphincter cells (Ki = 0.34 nM) but two sites in the ciliary cells (KH = 0.9 nM and KL = 49 nM). 4-DAMP was also the most potent in inhibiting carbachol-induced hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids (PI) in both cell types. However, the IC50 values for PI hydrolysis were several fold lower than those for [3H]QNB binding. Using these selective antagonists, our data supports the presence of functional muscarinic receptors of M3 subtype in human iris sphincter and ciliary cells. It also shows the presence of a second low affinity site in the ciliary smooth muscle cells that is recognized by 4-DAMP.},

Throughout the experiments, spontaneous contractions did not occur. Application of repetitive field stimulations evoked biphasic mechanical responses (i.e. an initial phasic contraction followed by long lasting relaxation) of the isolated human iris dilator. These mechanical responses were abolished by 10(-7) M tetrodotoxin (a nerve poison), thereby indicating that the mechanical responses were neurogenic. Furthermore, the initial phasic contractions and following muscle relaxation were selectively blocked by phentolamine (10(-5) M) and atropine (10(-5) M), respectively. The degree of the muscle relaxation to that of contraction was much larger than that assumed by other investigators who used tissues from different species. The present results indicate that the human iris dilator muscle is innervated by adrenergic excitatory and cholinergic inhibitory nerves, and that cholinergic inhibitory innervations in this muscle may support the cholinergic miosis in the iris sphincter muscle.},
