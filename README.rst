Neuronal Correlates of Occulometric Parameters in Face Recognition

Pupillometry is a simple yet versatile physiological method with ample applications in neuropsychology.
While initially considered a marker for arousal and emotionality, pupillometry is more recently used as a marker for cognitive load.
In this study we use a behavioural task based on both emotion and pattern recognition to determine whether:
(a) emotional perception impacts the pupil dilation response differently from equivalent non-emotional cognitive load;
(b) perception of different emotions influences the pupil dilation response differently.
We use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test whether pupil diameter is a reliable indicator of locus coeruleus activity, 
and whether any discrepancies can be accounted for by the type of task being performed. 
We are complementing the above with psychometric and genetic testing - the results of which may help us better span the gap from psychological to biological research.
We enrich the informative potential of the above and the transparency of our work by implementing the very latest “open science” concepts and technologies.
